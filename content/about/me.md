I am Bogdan Katishev. A simple man from Belgium that loves working in the fields of IT and Open Source stuff. Since I was a kid, I loved working with computers and I started programming at a very young age. Later, this became my hobby and this never stopped.

In a nutshell, I did a lot of coding in my free time. My first programming language that I learned, was Visual Basic. Later on, I started learning PHP, C#, Python, C and finally Javascript.

Because of all these interests in programming languages, I started making websites for friends and close relatives for free. Then more and more people started telling me that I needed to ask money for what I did and that's how I started my small business in making websites for small companies.

After a while, my interests in programming kept going down and I really wanted to find something else that made the balance between programming. That's when I discovered another side in the world of "IT", that's is called: Operations. This discovery was made at an age of 16 and this was just another whole world to be discovered by me.

My curiosity was high so I decided to start doing a lot of research. I started learning Bash Scripting, Basic Linux System Administration, Databases, Network Engineering, Computer Security, Virtualization and so on...

This was also when I started discovering Open Source stuff and that is how my love for Open Source began to grow.

Now, I am currently working as an Open Source Consultant at Inuits.
